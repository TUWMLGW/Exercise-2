# Exercise 2: Neural Network Implementation & Comparative Analysis

This project explores and compares three approaches to building neural networks:

1. **From Scratch:**  
   Implementing a neural network using only Python and NumPy, with all forward and backward propagation coded manually.

2. **PyTorch:**  
   Building and training neural networks using the PyTorch deep learning framework.

3. **LLM-Generated:**  
   Using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate neural network architectures, which are then implemented and trained.

Each approach is applied to two distinct datasets, experimenting with different hyperparameters and network depths to analyze performance and flexibility.
